# Linux Command Reference App

This is a simple GUI application for quickly referencing and executing Linux commands on **Arch Linux** using **Tkinter**. The app loads command categories dynamically from JSON files and allows users to copy or execute commands directly.

## Features

✅ Tabbed interface for different command categories (Arch, Gaming, System, Flatpak, etc.)\
✅ Search functionality to quickly find commands\
✅ Resizable window for better usability\
✅ Commands are loaded dynamically from JSON files\
✅ Click to copy or execute commands



## Installation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Since this app runs in a **Python virtual environment**, you’ll need to install the required dependencies:

sh
sudo pacman -S python python-virtualenv tk


### Step 2: Clone the Project

sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/linux-command-helper.git
cd linux-command-helper


### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows


### Step 4: Install Python Requirements

sh
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Step 5: Run the Application

sh
python app.py




## Configuration

### JSON Command Files

All command categories are stored in the `commands/` directory. Each category (Arch, Gaming, System, Flatpak) has its own JSON file, structured like this:

json
{
    "Update System": {
        "command": "sudo pacman -Syu"
    },
    "Install a Package": {
        "command": "sudo pacman -S <package>"
    }
}


You can **add, modify, or remove** commands by editing the JSON files without changing the main Python script.



## Optional: Create a Desktop Launcher

To run the app from your desktop, create a `.desktop` file:

sh
echo "[Desktop Entry]
Name=Linux Command Helper
Exec=/home/user/linux-command-helper/venv/bin/python /home/user/linux-command-helper/app.py
Icon=utilities-terminal
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;" > ~/.local/share/applications/linux-command-helper.desktop


Then, make it executable:

sh
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/linux-command-helper.desktop




## Troubleshooting

❓ **Issue: The app does not start**\
✅ Ensure you are in the correct virtual environment:

sh
source venv/bin/activate


✅ Check for missing dependencies:

sh
pip install -r requirements.txt


✅ Verify that you have Tkinter installed:

sh
python -c "import tkinter; print(tkinter.TkVersion)"


❓ **Issue: JSON files are missing**\
✅ Ensure that the `commands/` directory exists and contains JSON files.
